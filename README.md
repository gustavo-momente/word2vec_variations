word2vec_variations
===================

** Work in progress ** 
===================
Moving and documentation files from the previous BitBucket repertoire


## **Dependencies**
-----------------------
This project uses `Python 2.7.x`. Except for the files in _word2vec_ folder that are in `C` as they're the Mikolov et al. implementation from <https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/>, from exception to `compute-accuracy-w.c` and `word2vec-g.c` that are modfied versions of their _word2vec_ counterparts.

So for the `Python` code the folloing dependencies are required:

- Numpy
- matplotlib
- Sklearn
- NLTK
